🌱 AI-Powered Eco-Friendly Fertilizer Guidance Portal

This repository contains the full stack implementation for an intelligent web application designed to provide personalized, sustainable fertilizer recommendations to farmers in real-time, based on qualitative feedback and soil/crop data.

Project Summary

The system leverages a Generative AI Agent (Gemini) orchestrated via n8n to translate natural language farmer observations (e.g., "leaves are yellow, growth is slow") into structured, actionable agricultural plans. It uniquely cross-references these plans with a simulated local stock list, ensuring all recommendations are practical and immediately available.

🏗️ Architecture and Technical Stack

The project utilizes a decoupled, three-tier architecture with the following components:

Frontend (Presentation): HTML5, CSS3 (Custom), JavaScript (Fetch API).

Role: User interface, authentication simulation, form data submission, and display of structured results.

Middleware : n8n (Webhook, AI Agent, Code Node, Respond to Webhook).

Role: API gateway, workflow management, data processing, and real-time communication pipeline.

Intelligence (Core Logic): Gemini LLM (via API).

Role: Performs diagnostic reasoning, formulates eco-friendly solutions, and structures the output data.

Backend (Auth - Planned): Node.js/Express, SQL/MongoDB, JWT, OTP.

Role: Planned system for secure user registration and login (using OTP).

🚀 Key Features

Real-Time AI Diagnostics

Description: Converts raw textual feedback into structured data, diagnosing the crop condition (e.g., Nitrogen Deficiency) instantly.

Value: Bridges the gap between qualitative farmer observations and quantitative plans.

Sustainable Focus

Description: Recommendations prioritize eco-friendly solutions (Compost, Biofertilizers, Crop Rotation) alongside necessary chemical inputs.

Value: Promotes environmental responsibility and reduces farmer costs.

Stock-Aware Planning

Description: AI recommendations are validated against a predefined list of available fertilizer stock, ensuring immediate feasibility.

Value: Reduces supply chain delays and improves center inventory visibility.

Personalized Frontend

Description: User login simulation saves the user's name locally (localStorage) and displays a personalized welcome on the dashboard.

Value: Enhances user experience and application engagement.

Interactive Modal Form

Description: The complex AI Feedback Form is integrated into the homepage as a click-activated modal, allowing access from any page without navigation loss.

Value: Improves usability and application flow.
